## Testing
I checked my code on the on the following sites:
- My CSS code on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and it passed
- My HTML code on [W3](https://validator.w3.org/) and it passed
- My JavaScript code on [BeautifyTools](https://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php) and it passed

When you first land on the webpage, you might see a loading animation depending on how fast your internet is.
With internet speed in mind, there will only be 5 pictures generated at first. And adding on more as you scroll

If you want to save an image you like or know where it comes from, all you have to do is click on it, and it will take you to the original source.
